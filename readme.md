# spotify-qt-player
Spotify playback client using the [Spotify Web Playback SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk). As it is web based, currently it relies on [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/). Meant to be used with [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt) as it doesn't have a playback device, but should work with anything.
